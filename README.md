1.	Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionality through well-defined interfaces.
Create an Employee class having data members' Name, Eid, and Basic_Salary, to calculate the HRA is 20% of Basic Salary and DA is 25% of Basic salary and MA is 300 rupee. implement the following queries:
  a) Display the name and gross salary of an employee whose name starts With 'n'
Ans:Row in range(0,7):    
    for Col in range(0,7):     
        if ((Col == 1 or Col == 5) or (Row == 3 and Col > 1 and Col < 6)):  
            str=str+"*"    
        else:      
            str=str+" "    
    str=str+"\n"    
print(str);
  b).Display the Eid and gross salary whose Eid is equal to 107.
Ans:name = "Mohit"
for letter in name:
    print(letter, end=' ')
  c)  Count the total number of employees whose salary more than 20000/-
Ans:def is_palindrome(username):
    username = username.lower()
    return username == username[::-1]
username = input("Enter a Name ")
if is_palindrome(username):
    print(f"{username} is a palindrome!")
else:
    print(f"{username} is not a palindrome.")
